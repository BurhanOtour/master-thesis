To my first tutor, who taught me that success relies above all on a man's belief, thank you Mama for your endless tender, support, and love. To my golden shield, with his endless support in any decision I made hard and easy to reach my goal, thank you Dad for your having my back. All the love to you Omar and Khaled, whom I share with the same blood and flesh. I also want to send my hearty gratitude to my second family, Ivona and Abdul, for their unconditional giving through all the study years I spent here in Germany, thank you. I also want to extend my thanks to my bigger family and friends who believed in me all this time, thank you from the heart. \\

Special thanks go to Alexander Bigerl for his support to accomplish this work, and to the data science research group at Paderborn University, led by Prof. Dr. Axel Ngonga, for the great opportunity to collaborate with their research. I would also like to express my deepest appreciation and thank my former Boss Alexander Starke and colleagues at Diebold Nixdorf for their support to build up my career life. My thanks are extended to my supervisor, Sven Merschjohann, at Fraunhofer IEM. \\

To all nice people, friends, and anonymous supporters whom I met along the way, thank you. Last but not least, to my Lord for giving me the strength, the wisdom, and support to follow the straight path, all the praises and thanks for Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful.\\
