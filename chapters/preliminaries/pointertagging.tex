\section{Pointer Tagging}
\label{sec:preliminaries:pointertagging}

Pointer Tagging is a low-level programming technique that uses the spare low bits in a pointer to encode additional information. Using the Pointer tagging technique, pointer value (initially a memory address before tagging) can hold extra information about the point-to heap object or can be used as a meta-data to further describe the usage of the pointer data. Pointer tagging is mainly enabled because of the way heap objects are situated and accessed on modern computer architectures.

\subsection{Data Structure Alignment}

Data alignment (also referred to as data structure padding) is a way in which heap objects are arranged and accessed by the CPU. CPUs in modern computer architecture (say 64-bit architecture) read data from and write data to memory more efficiently when data is aligned. \\

On an abstract level, computer memory can be seen as an array of words or bytes, each with its own address. Unlike bytes, the term word has ambiguate meaning. In the context of this work, we are targeting the generic term in the context of CPU architecture. That is, a "processor word" refers to the size of a processor register or memory address register. The term word also refers to the size of CPU instruction, or the size of a pointer depending on the exact CPU architecture. For example, in a 64-bit architecture, the word size (also pointer size) is 64 bits = 8 bytes.\\

Generally, when a source program is executed, it is loaded into memory and put into a process p for execution. All data objects in the program are mapped at certain point in time (during compilation or execution) to a physical memory address [ref: operating system concept]. Let us suppose we have the following snippet written in C language:\\

long *x = new long(123.4); // x = x21DE
int* a = new int(123);  // a = x21E6
char* c = new char(‘A’);  // c = x21EE

According to C language specification, the size of integer value in memory is 4 bytes and size of char value is 1 byte [C spec]. When we execute the previously mentioned statements, however, the compiler (or linker) books 8 bytes of memory to hold the integer value and not 4 bytes as expected. The reason is that, the compiler adds paddings to the heap objects in order to align them in memory. The same applies to the character value, as shown in figure 1 (on my notebook). \\

Why data alignment? The CPU can access the memory only in word-sized chunks. So if our data always starts at a word it can be fetched efficiently. If it were to start somewhere in the middle of a word, the CPU will need to wait two or more memory cycles to fetch data from or write data to memory causing an increase in the CPU stall period which results in a significant performance overhead. 


many modern compilers implementations handle data alignment in memory automatically, example includes C, C++, Rust, C# compilers.
