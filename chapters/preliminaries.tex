\chapter{Preliminaries and Foundations}
\label{ch:preliminaries}

This chapter is logically divided into two main parts. The first part presents the tooling and techniques I utilized to implement the space-reduction solution. The first section \ref{sec:notation} introduces common notations and terminologies used through out the work. Next, the pointer tagging technique is presented in section \ref{sec:preliminaries:pointertagging}). The first part is finalized with a quick overview on template-meta programming in modern C++ (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:cpp}). \\ 

In the second part, I visit the semantic web topic (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:semanticweb}). Afterwards I delve into Tentris in section \ref{sec:preliminaries:tentris} where I present its concept and implementation. More deeply, I describe how its realized by presenting its main underlying data structure, Hypertrie.
