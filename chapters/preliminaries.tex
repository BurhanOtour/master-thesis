\chapter{Preliminaries and Foundations}
\label{ch:preliminaries}

This chapter is logically divided into two main parts. The first part presents the tooling and techniques I utilized to implement the space-reduction solution. The first section \ref{sec:notation} introduces common notations and terminologies used through out the work. Next, the pointer tagging technique is presented in section \ref{sec:preliminaries:pointertagging}. \\ 

In the second part, the semantic web topic is visited in section \ref{sec:preliminaries:semanticweb} before delving into into Tentris in section \ref{sec:preliminaries:tentris} where its concept and implementation are discussed.
