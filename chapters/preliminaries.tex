\chapter{Preliminaries and Foundations}
\label{ch:preliminaries}

This chapter is divided logically into two main parts. The first part presents the tooling and techniques I utilized to implement aspects of my space-reduction solution. I take into consideration the pointer tagging technique (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:tentris}) and the utilization of template-meta programming in modern C++ (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:cpp}). In addition, the first part introduces common notations and terminologies that I  use through out the work (Sec. \ref{sec:notation}). \\ 

In the second part, I present the Tentris triple store system with a deep focus on its indexing data structure Hypertrie in Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:tentris}. 
Hypertrie represents the subject under focus upon which the space utilization enhancement is applied.
