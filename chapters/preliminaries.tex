\chapter{Preliminaries and Foundations}
\label{ch:preliminaries}

This chapter is logically divided into two main parts. The first part presents the tooling and techniques I utilized to implement aspects of my space-reduction solution. I take into consideration the pointer tagging technique (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:pointertagging}) and the utilization of template-meta programming in modern C++ (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:cpp}). In addition, the first part introduces common notations and terminologies that I  use through out the work (Sec. \ref{sec:notation}). \\ 

In the second part, I give an overview of the semantic web topic (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:semanticweb}). Afterwards I delve into Tentris in section \ref{sec:preliminaries:tentris} where I present its concept and implementation. More deeply, I describe how its realized by presenting its main underlying data structure, Hypertrie.
