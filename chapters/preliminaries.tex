\chapter{Preliminaries and Foundations}
\label{ch:preliminaries}

This chapter is logically divided into two main parts. The first part presents the tooling and techniques I utilized to implement aspects of my space-reduction solution. I take into consideration the pointer tagging technique (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:pointertagging}) and the utilization of template-meta programming in modern C++ (Sec. \ref{sec:preliminaries:cpp}). In addition, the first part introduces common notations and terminologies that I  use through out the work (Sec. \ref{sec:notation}). \\ 

In the second part, I present \textbf{Tentris}  in section \ref{sec:preliminaries:tentris}. An RDF triple store based on Tensor arithmetic. I describe its main principle and implementation in a nutshell. Primarily, I focus on its indexing data structure Hypertrie. 
\todo{Do I need to mention here I build my solution on top of Tentris?}
